# EasyDrawing

## Intro
This is a spigot plugin used to generate text and image based builds. You can draw text using "/draw Text" and you can create images using "/draw url". Note that the url must point to the image. You also may need to use a link shortener beacuse Minecraft limits it's message size. Your plugin will automatically be resized. More resize options will be added in the future.

## Dependencies

This plugin requires WorldEdit or FastAsyncWorldEdit. [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://github.com/boy0001/FastAsyncWorldedit) is recommended and will cause the draw command to work much faster.

# Modifying This Plugin

The code base is pretty sloppy, with duplicate code and other problems. Modify at your own risk.
