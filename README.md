# EasyDrawing

## Intro
This is a spigot plugin used to generate text and image based builds. You can draw text using "/draw Text" and you can create images using "/draw url". Note that the url must point to the image. You also may need to use a link shortener beacuse Minecraft limits it's message size. Your plugin will automatically be resized. More resize options will be added in the future.

## LAG NOTICE (Draw command)
I'm still working on adding AsyncWorldEdit suppourt. This means all operations are done on Spigot's main thread, or in other words, this plugin is a bit laggy. It's recommended you have a decent computer / server when using the draw command.
